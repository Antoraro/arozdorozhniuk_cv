  static const String DESCRIPTION = "I’m a professional JavaScript Developer with about 10 years of total experience and looking for a job opportunity in a product company, preferably with NodeJS+ReactJS related stack. During this time I have been working with JavaScript (ES6/7), React / Redux, Angular, Typescript, Canvas/WebGL, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, numerous third-party APIs, Ruby and Python and all other cool stuff. I’ve developed a lot of back-end applications and services using Node.js, also being involved in projects powered by Ruby on Rails, Python (Flask) and .NET have given to me a solid understanding of client-server and server-server processes along with such role as DBA. Also I had built several projects from scratch, from big enterprise to small startups. Had some quality time mentoring and guiding other deleveopers. Involved in architecture design as well as implementation CI/CD. Involved in building applications for business needs(infrastructure and non-infrastructure), always try to find a solution that will meet business and engineering goals. As you might notice when it comes to any back-end or front-end related job - I know how to handle it. Also I might consider job opportunity to transition to Head of Engineering or RnD as at this point I’m somewhat interested in project and resource planning, processes tuning, personal development of engineers and management.";
